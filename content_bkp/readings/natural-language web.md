description: Intro to natural language web
---

“NLWeb is an open project developed by Microsoft that aims to make it simple to create a rich, natural language interface for websites using the model of their choice and their own data.
..
*Every NLWeb instance is also a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server, allowing websites to make their content discoverable and accessible to agents and other participants in the MCP ecosystem if they choose. Ultimately, we believe NLWeb can play a similar role to HTML in the emerging agentic web.*.”
