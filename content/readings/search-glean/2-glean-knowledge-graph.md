# Using Knowledge Graphs
KGs address LLM shortcomings.
- **Multi-hop Reasoning and Precision**
    LLMs struggle with multi-hop reasoning, enterprise-specific language, and understanding process or usage patterns.  KGs help mitigate ambiguity and improve reliability
- **Code and OKR Mapping**
    For tasks like assessing "How is Project X doing against its OKRs?", LLMs are not "well-suited to surfacing those signals in the first place." Knowledge graphs map "code artifacts... to specific projects" and "organizational objectives."
