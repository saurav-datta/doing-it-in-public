**How Generative Engine Optimization (GEO) Rewrites the Rules of Search**
https://a16z.com/geo-over-seo/

- **Highlights**
> Today, with LLMs like GPT-4o, Gemini, and Claude acting as the interface for how people find information, visibility means showing up directly in the answer itself, rather than ranking high on the results page.

> AI-native search is becoming fragmented across platforms like Instagram, Amazon, and Siri, each powered by different models and user intents

> Queries are [longer](https://www.semrush.com/blog/chatgpt-search-insights/) (23 words, on average, vs. 4), sessions are deeper (averaging 6 minutes), and responses vary by context and source.

> It’s no longer just about click-through rates, it’s about reference rates: how often your brand or content is cited or used as a source in model-generated answers

- **Measuring impact**
> 	Canada Goose used one such tool to gain insight into how LLMs referenced the brand — not just in terms of product features like warmth or waterproofing, but brand recognition itself. The takeaways were .... whether the model spontaneously mentioned the brand at all, an indicator of unaided awareness in the AI era.
